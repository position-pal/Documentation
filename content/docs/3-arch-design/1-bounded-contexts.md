Following the event storming session, the subsequent bounded contexts have been identified:

- **Users Management**: it is responsible for managing the users' lifecycle, from registration to deletion and the management of their profile information along with the authentication and authorization.
- **Groups Management**: it is responsible for managing the groups' lifecycle, from creation to deletion, and the management of the group's members.
- **Location Tracking**: it is responsible for managing the location tracking of the users, including the sharing of the location with groups' members, the reception of location updates, thw sending of SOS alerts and the management of their paths.
- **Notifications**: it is responsible for managing the notifications, including the push notifications to the users' devices.
- **Chat**: it is responsible for managing the chat between the users and the groups' members.

In the following sections, we will provide a detailed view of each bounded context, including its **_Ubiquitous Language_**, the **_Commands_** and the **_Events_** guiding the interactions between the different contexts.
These can be categorized as **_Driving_** or **_Driven Events_**: the former are the events triggered by the user's actions and that drives an application use case, while the latter are the events that are triggered by the system as a reaction to a use case or a system state change.
Moreover we distinguish between _Commands_ and _Events_ to highlight the difference between a request to perform an action (_Command_) and the notification of something meaningful that has happened (_Event_):

## Bounded Context Integration

The boundary of each bounded context delineates the scope of the context: models in different bounded context can be evolved and implemented independently, but they need to be integrated to provide a coherent service to the users.

DDD provides a set of patterns for defining relationship and integrations between bounded contexts to be reified in the so-called **Context Map**, a visual representation of the system's bounded contexts and the relationships between them.

The following diagram shows the context map of the PositionPal system:

![Context Map](/images/context-map.svg)

The **shared kernel** collects the shared entities and domain logic that are in common between the bounded contexts.
As per best practices, the overlapping module will be limited as much as possible to avoid coupling between the contexts and exposing only the part of the model that, otherwise, would be duplicated in all the contexts.

The **conformist** pattern applies to users and groups management context: the downstream context (Group Management) conform to the upstream context (Users Management) model to simplify the integration and avoid the complexity of translation between bounded contexts. Although this approach may constrain the downstream team's design flexibility, it significantly simplifies integration. Since the upstream context (Users Management) has more influence in this relationship, conforming to its model facilitates clearer communication and reduces integration overhead.
