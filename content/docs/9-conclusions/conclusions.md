Position Pal was a valuable learning experience in applying modern development practices in a real world scenario.

By utilizing Domain-Driven Design, the team gained a clearer understanding of the domain, which helped in the design and development phases of the whole system.

The incorporation of DevOps practices contributed to a more streamlined and predictable development process, while Kubernetes provided a powerful environment for managing deployments.

Overall, the project served as a modest yet effective exploration of building reliable microservices for creating a safe network among friends, with plenty of lessons learned along the way, including:

- real-time communication;
- distributed event-driven architecture design and implementation;
- advanced DVCS workflows and CI/CD pipelines;
- Kubernetes deployment and management;
- Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture principles;
- gRPC and REST API design and implementation;
- Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns;
- End to end and integration testing.

## Future works

In the future, we plan to improve the system by adding new features and enhancing existing ones. Some of the planned improvements include:

- User Interface improvements
  - better user experience;
  - native mobile App support.
- User service:
  - add group roles;
  - RBA (Role-Based Access Control) system.
- Chat service:
  - add XMPP protocol support;
  - improve notification system.
- Location service:
  - improve websocket connection management avoiding to create one connection per group;
  - add more alert conditions to notify users about dangerous situations in addition to those already existing, like deviation from the route;
- Notification service:
  - add email notification support.
