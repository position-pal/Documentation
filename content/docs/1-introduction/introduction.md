PositionPal is a **micro-services-based** application for creating **groups** of **trusted** users with whom to **share location**, **routes**, and **notify of dangerous or emergency situation** to create an _effective_ and _timely_ service and _support network_.

The idea comes from [some news](https://www.open.online/2024/04/04/scrivi-quando-arrivi-gruppo-whatsapp-ragazze/) read recently about young people who, on their way home at night in unsafe areas of the city, share their location in a WhatsApp group of users to support and watch each other.
