## What is PositionPal?

PositionPal is a **micro-services-based** application for creating **groups** of **trusted** users with whom to **share location**, **routes**, and **notify of dangerous or emergency situation** to create an _effective_ and _timely_ service and _support network_.

The idea comes from [some news](https://www.open.online/2024/04/04/scrivi-quando-arrivi-gruppo-whatsapp-ragazze/) read recently about young people who, on their way home at night in unsafe areas of the city, share their location in a WhatsApp group of users to support and watch each other.

## The Problem

Personal safety concerns are increasingly significant in urban environments, especially for those traveling alone at night or through unfamiliar areas. While general-purpose messaging apps like WhatsApp allow basic location sharing, they lack specialized safety features and automation that could make the difference in emergency situations.

## Our Solution

PositionPal transforms the ad-hoc "text when you get home" practice into a comprehensive safety system with features specifically designed for personal security:

- **Trusted Groups**: Create circles of trusted friends, family members, or colleagues
- **Real-time Location Sharing**: Share your precise location with selected groups
- **Route Tracking**: Set expected routes and arrival times
- **Automated Alerts**: Generate notifications when deviating from planned routes or not reaching destinations on time
- **Emergency Notifications**: Quick access to alert trusted contacts in dangerous situations
- **Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained permissions for when and with whom your location is shared

## Getting Started

The following sections will guide you through the architecture, design and implementation of PositionPal, demonstrating how it can become an essential tool in your personal safety toolkit.
